/**
 * 
 * Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area
Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.
* 
* 
* Solution:
* We need to find the overlapping region between the two rectangles. If there is no overlap, the are will be zero.
* 1)First we find all the co-ordinates of both of the rectangles
* 2)we check if there is an overlap or not (by comparing the range of the co-ordinates of both rectangles)
