# practiceProblemSolving
This is a collection of some of the popular problems in algorithm and in technical interviews. I did programming for my learning purpose and the 
code may have some references from other resources. I have tried my best to give credit to the resources I referred.

Most of the problems were taken from the following resources:

1) Leetcode.com
2) Careercup.com
3) Cracking the Coding Interviews Book

Thank you.
